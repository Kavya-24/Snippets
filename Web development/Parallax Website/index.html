            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders. A paraglider is an airplane in your backpack. No seriously! It is an aircraft which is powered by the wind and when not flying, fits in a backpack easy enough to be carried around. Paragliding is the closest a human being can get to the feeling of flying. A paraglider is a simple aircraft with no machines and no fuel, just the wind and pilot’s flying skills.
                <br><br>
                Paragliding equipment comprises a wing or canopy called a ‘paraglider’ made up of two layers of fabric made of high-performance non-porous materials such as rip-stop polyester or nylon. The wing is connected to a harness with a network of suspended lines made of an immensely strong material like Kevlar. The pilot straps on this harness and after a foot launch into the wind is able to sit comfortably in the harness and control the flight. Paragliders have just two controls – on the left and right of the pilot which are used for turning and as brakes.

                Surfing is a water sport done in the ocean or sea. The surfer uses their surfboard to catch a wave and ride in towards the shore. Surfing was invented by the Polynesians at least 4000 years ago. Surfing made its Olympic debut at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. It has become a popular sport among both men and women of all ages. With lifestyles and regimens freer than those of most sports, surfers comprise a unique culture.

                The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
